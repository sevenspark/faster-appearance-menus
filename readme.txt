If your Appearance > Menus screen has become very laggy after upgrading to WordPress 3.6 and you have a lot of menu items, this should speed it up.  [Full details](http://sevenspark.com/wordpress/speeding-up-the-appearance-menus-screen-in-wordpress-3-6)



== Description ==

The new accessibility javascript in the Appearance > Menus panel in WordPress 3.6 can significantly slow the page load speed when using a large number of menu items (> 50).  This plugin defers the accessibility processing to eliminate the scripting bottleneck and allow the Appearance > Menus screen to run much faster and more responsively.
